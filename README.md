# Don’t look up: Air Pollution - Data analysis on the PM2.5 

# Context 

Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental and health issues across OECD countries and beyond. As European citizen, Luisa and I wanted to study how is the air we breathe in the EU?
We focused on the PM2.5, a fine particulate matter which is the air pollutant that poses the greatest risk to health globally, affecting more people than any other pollutant. 

To carry out this study, we used 4 datasets:
 - Population exposure to PM2.5 (Unit: Micrograms per cubic metre)
 - Mortality from exposure to PM2.5 (Unit: Per 1 000 000 inhabitants)
 - Socio-economic data of the countries 
 
 Where: European countries (27)
 
 Date: 1990 - 2019
 
 Source: OECD data (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)
 
 - Scientific publications on the air pollution (Wikidata - Worldwide - from 1990-2022)



# Deliverables 
We created a dashboard on Tableau that you can find here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maria.policarpo/viz/Project6-Airpollution/Histria1?publish=yes

Visualization:
- map of the exposure and mortality to PM2.5
- top 5 of the countries with highest and lowest level of exposure to PM2.5
- focus on the socio-economic profiles of those countries
- socio-economic profiles of the European countries 
- evolution of the number of scientific publications on the air pollution (1999 to 2022)

We also used machine learning (linear regression) to predict the PM2.5 exposure in the upcoming years. 

All the code is in Github’s folders listed below.
